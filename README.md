Assignment:
Create an Airflow DAG that implements a simple ETL process. For example, your DAG should:

Be defined in a file (for instance, assignments/airflow_dag.py).
Contain at least three tasks:
extract_task: Simulate data extraction.
transform_task: Simulate data transformation.
load_task: Simulate data loading.
Have a DAG with a valid schedule (e.g., daily).
Instructions to Students:

Create a public GitHub repository (or use one provided by your instructor) that contains your assignment.
Place your DAG file in an assignments folder.
Ensure your DAG is written using Airflowâ€™s best practices.
(Optional) Include a README.md that describes your DAG.
Example README excerpt:
